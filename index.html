    <hr>
    <p>In unit 1 I learned about HTML, I learned the basic structures of html.  An. HTML documents have two main parts: the head and the body. But firstly every HTML document should start by declaring what it is. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear or act in a certain way. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Our page title is a heading, level one, for which we use the tags.</p>

    <p>I learned more HTML, creating how to add images, text bigger sized more, more of how to insert links. We did AG packets and laid them on the internet. We used all our knowledge to create basic apps with partners and show our knowledge on code.org

    <p>I learned CSS. Css is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. Some examples of CSS coding is color: red; - changes the text color of contents to red. font-size: 20px; - changes the font size of contents to 20px. background-color: yellow; - sets the background of the element to yellow.</p>

    <p>I learned Javascript and Pseudocode. JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to dynamically update content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms animation.</p>
