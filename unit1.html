    <b>Lesson #1</b>
    <h4>What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students?</h4>
    <p>I can be pretty focused sometimes but i'd lose track often. I think it's because of our surroundings. Sometimes on a computer we see and learn new features everyday so it makes us lose focus of what's happening behind and around us. For this class though , I put the keyboard away , write down as much notes as I can so I could be prepared for what's happening next</p>

  <b>Lesson #2</b>
    <h4>Recall when you built your information sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?</h4>
    <p>The difference between two or more is if you added more lights , you could've had different lights to help you understand what is being asked.</p>

    <b>Lesson #3</b>
    <h4>How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before?</h4>
    <p>I would explain to someone who had never seen numbers before by showing them these different ways</p>

    <b>Lesson #4</b>
    <h4>What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal systems?</h4>
    <p>The binary system works the same way as decimal. The only difference is that instead of multiplying the digit by a power of ‍ , we multiply it by a power of ‍ . That's the same as ( 0 × 8 ) + ( 0 × 4 ) + ( 0 × 2 ) + ( 1 × 1 ) ‍ , or 0 + 0 + 0 + 1</p>

    <b>Lesson #5 </b>
    <h4>When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?</h4>
    <p>Yes, the bits can be used to represent fractions of a number because you are able to put the O as well as the ' symbol.</p>

    <b>Lesson #7</b>
    <h4>Your computer science teacher asks you to sample a black and white image that is 4" x 6". How would you sample the image to provide a good digital approximation using the pixelation widget? What sample size would you use? How would your decision affect the digital representation?</h4>
    <p>I would sample this image by extending it to make it bigger.</p>

    <b>Lesson #8</b>
    <h4>Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital color image.</h4>
    <p>It took lot of time because of how we needed to find and determine the coding</p>

    <b>Lesson #9</b>
    <h4>An author is preparing to send their book to a publisher as an email attachment. The file on their computer is 1000 bytes. When they attach the file to their email, it shows as 750 bytes. The author gets very upset because they are concerned that part of their book has been deleted by the email provider.</h4>
    <p>If I could talk to the author , I would explain whats happening in their book by the quality and the way it is represented</p>

    <b>lesson #10</b>
    <h4>You’ve been given a new cell phone with a 2 gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text messages, images, video, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression? Which of these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why?</h4>
    <p>I believe that video and audios are best compression because you sometimes cannot compress text unless the person says it</p>
