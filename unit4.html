    <b>Lesson #1</b>
    <h4>What will the value of score be at the end of the program?</h4>
    <p>B. The score is 4</p>

  <b>Lesson #2</b>
    <h4>Explain in your own words the process of creating and updating a variable. How does the Counter Pattern with Event work?</h4>
    <p>It's important for element IDs to have meaningful names as it allows for easy identification for the programmer to review the code and see which object is doing what and can be easily identified.When the event is triggered, the variable is updated. The current value of the variable is increased or decreased by a set amount. The new value is stored in the variable.</p>

    <b>Lesson #5 </b>
    <h4>Can a computer evaluate an expression to something between true and false? Can you write an expression to deal with a "maybe" answer?</h4>
    <p>Yes the computer can evaluate an expression to something between true and false. A computer can't deal with a maybe answer. This will give an expression to deal with a "maybe" answer for humans because somebody might have a different opinion.</p>

      <b>Lesson #6 </b>
      <h4>What does it mean to put the most specific case first?. Why is it important to put the most specific case first? What types of errors does it help avoid?</h4>
      <p>It's important to put the most specific case first because the computer runs code from top to bottom and if the most selective part is anywhere but the top then this will create massive bugs. When creating an if-else-if statement you should always make your first condition the most specific.</p>

      <b>Lesson #9 </b>
      <h4>In your own words describe the benefits of creating functions in your code?</h4>
      <p>Creating functions in my own code allows for complex repeated actions to have a name and then can be easily repeated again. Otherwise, the code would be robust and take longer than it should program and not have to take up that much space if specific functions can be repeated which saves a compound number of bits.</p>
