    <b>Lesson #1</b>
    <h4>Think about your typical day. When are you using the Internet? For what purposes? What role does it have in your life?</h4>
    <p>I use the internet to check answers for certain math problems to make sure my work is correct</p>

  <b>Lesson #2</b>
    <h4>Describe two different paths that a message could take from Person A to Person D.</h4>
    <p>One path would be going from A to E to C to D. Another path would be going from A to B to D. The IP address makes it easier for devices to connect and communicate on the internet because the devices can sense there is something nearby to connect to.</p>

    <b>Lesson #3</b>
    <h4>Describe how the Internet Protocol (IP) allows devices to easily connect and communicate on the Internet.</h4>
    <p>IP information is attached to each packet, and this information helps routers to send packets to the right place. Every device or domain that connects to the Internet is assigned an IP address, and as packets are directed to the IP address attached to them, data arrives where it is needed.</p>

    <b>Lesson #4</b>
    <h4>What are the benefits of building redundancy into a network? What are the potential issues with building redundancy?</h4>
    <p>Building redundancy into a network allows the system to be fault tolerant. Even if individual components fail, the information may take an alternative path so it can still reach the intended recipient. Redundancy can become an issue when information takes longer, less efficient paths to reach a destination.</p>

    <b>Lesson #5 </b>
    <h4>Table</h4>
    <p>Ip- Rules for addressing and sending data across the internet by assigning unique numbers to each connected device</p>
    <p>TCP- Takes inventory of all packets in the datastream to ensure they are successfully sent and received</p>
    <p>Packet- A small segment of data that is sent over the internet</p>
    <p>Datastream- A sequence of data that is sent over the internet</p>
    <p>UPD- A protocol that allows devices to send and receive data across the internet</p>

    <b>Lesson #6</b>
    <h4>What problem does the DNS solve? How does the DNS help the world wide web scale so that billions of users can access billions of web pages?</h4>
    <p>the problem that DNS, or the domain name system, solves is that it is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses. DNS helps the World Wide Web scale since it is used by many different computers that are all connected to the network.</p>
